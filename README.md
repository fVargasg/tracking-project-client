A web site to manage projects online.

## Development process and problem-solving strategy

I create user stories that project was going to have.
I create Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) tha project was going to have.
I create the neccesary wire frames for the project.

I started the backend api first and then the front end client.

I deployed both projects online.
